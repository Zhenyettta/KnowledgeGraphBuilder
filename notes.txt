KGGEN deepseek no relation with Matthew Brettingham (1699–1769) was an English architect who rose from modest origins to become one of the best-known architects of his generation. Much of his principal work has since been demolished, particularly his work in London, where he revolutionised the design of the grand townhouse. As a result, he is often overlooked today, remembered principally for his Palladian remodelling of numerous country houses, many of them in East Anglia. Brettingham's practice constructing townhouses for the aristocracy was substantial. Major commissions included Norfolk House and Cumberland House. Drawing inspiration from Italian urban palazzi, and from Andrea Palladio's rural villas, he created a style and arrangements of rooms perfectly suited to the mid–18th century nobility. As Brettingham neared the pinnacle of his career, Palladianism began to fall out of fashion and neoclassicism was introduced, championed by the young Robert Adam.
