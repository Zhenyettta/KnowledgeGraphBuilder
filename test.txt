Google LLC was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998 while they were PhD students at Stanford University. The company later acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion and expanded its operations worldwide. In 2015, Google was reorganized under a new parent company, Alphabet Inc. Sundar Pichai became the CEO of Google, succeeding Larry Page. In the same year, Google launched its artificial intelligence division, DeepMind, which later developed AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a professional human player in the board game Go. Additionally, Alphabet invested in Waymo, an autonomous vehicle company, and collaborated with multiple automotive manufacturers. Google also partnered with NASA to advance quantum computing research.
