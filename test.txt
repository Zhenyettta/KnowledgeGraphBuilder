In 2019, Dr. Victoria Holmes, a researcher at Oxford University, began collaborating with DeepTech Innovations, a London-based startup focusing on quantum computing. Together with Professor Liam Ward from MIT, they aimed to develop a next-generation quantum processor, nicknamed Q-Gen, which would theoretically outperform existing supercomputers by a factor of 100. This research attracted significant funding from Global Ventures, a well-known investment firm headquartered in Berlin, which allocated $25 million to the project. The funding announcement came shortly after DeepTech Innovations received a research grant from the European Research Council.

By early 2021, DeepTech Innovations had hired engineers from various tech giants, including Google, IBM, and Intel, to advance the Q-Gen project. Meanwhile, Oxford University and MIT signed a separate agreement to exchange doctoral students working on high-performance computing. This agreement was facilitated by Dr. Holmes, who also secured a scholarship program sponsored by Tech4Good, a nonprofit organization promoting ethical AI and technology education. During this period, Professor Ward spent six months at Oxford University advising the Q-Gen research team on quantum algorithms for secure data encryption.

In mid-2022, Dr. Holmes left DeepTech Innovations to establish Quantum Horizon, a startup in San Francisco focusing on fault-tolerant quantum hardware. Despite her departure, Global Ventures continued to fund DeepTech Innovations, increasing its stake in the company through a new round of financing. The European Research Council further renewed its grant for an additional two years, prompting DeepTech Innovations to open a satellite office in Paris for expanded collaborations with European universities. Quantum Horizon, on the other hand, quickly garnered attention from Silicon Valley investors, including Pioneer Capital, which led a $15 million seed round to accelerate research on cryogenic cooling systems for quantum chips.

Shortly thereafter, Tech4Good recognized Dr. Holmes with its annual Tech Visionary Award for her contributions to quantum computing and her efforts to promote diversity in STEM fields. Quantum Horizon announced plans to partner with Stanford University on a new initiative that will explore the applications of quantum processors in medical diagnostics. Meanwhile, DeepTech Innovations and IBM entered negotiations regarding a potential joint venture to leverage IBMâ€™s manufacturing capabilities for mass-producing Q-Gen processors. By late 2023, experts predicted that both Quantum Horizon and DeepTech Innovations would be at the forefront of the global quantum computing industry, with significant breakthroughs expected in the years ahead.
